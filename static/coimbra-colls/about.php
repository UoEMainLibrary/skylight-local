            <div class="content">
                The idea for the Coimbra Group Collections Platform developed out of the virtual exhibition platform, which was created for the Coimbra Group conference
                hosted by the University of Edinburgh in June 2017.
                This unique collaboration brought together items from across the Coimbra Group institutions.
