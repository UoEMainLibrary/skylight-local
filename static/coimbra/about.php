            <div class="content">
                This online exhibition celebrates shared cultural heritage across the Coimbra Group of
                European universities. To coincide with the June 2017 Coimbra Conference, hosted at the
                University of Edinburgh, this is the first time that Collections from across the 35 member
                institutions have been brought together in this unique collaboration.
                <br><br>
                Over 70 objects have been selected that straddle thousands of miles of the continent and millions of years of its history.
                From the stunning Augsburg Art Cabinet to a petrified mammoth tooth, these objects highlight
                the rich cultural diversity and uniqueness of University collections around Europe.
