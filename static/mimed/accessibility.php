    <p>At this time, we believe all items are within our control. Unless specified otherwise, a complete solution, or significant improvement, will be in place for those items within our control by March 2024.</p>
    <h3>Disproportionate burden</h3>
    <p>We are not currently claiming that any accessibility problems would be a disproportionate burden to fix.</p>
    <h3>Content that's not within the scope of the accessibility regulations</h3>
    <p>At this time, we do not believe that any content is outside the scope of the accessibility regulations.</p>

    <h2>What we're doing to improve accessibility</h2>
    <p>At this time, we believe all items are within our control. We will continue to address the accessibility issues highlighted to deliver a solution or suitable workaround. We are looking to move this site to a new content management system within the next 12 months and will be working to ensure this resolves the accessibility issues. Unless specified otherwise, a complete solution or significant improvement will be in place for those items within our control by March 2024.</p>
    <p>While we are in the process of resolving these accessibility issues, or where we are unable, we will ensure reasonable adjustments are in place to make sure no user is disadvantaged. As changes are made, we will continue to review accessibility and retest the accessibility of this website.</p>

    <h2>Preparation of this accessibility statement</h3>
    <p><strong>This statement was first prepared on 7th August 2020. It was last reviewed on 23th February 2023.</strong></p>
    <p>This website was first tested on 7th August 2020, reviewed on 15th September 2021 and then again on 23rd February 2022. The testing was initially carried out by The University of Edinburgh Library and University Collections Digital Library Development team using the automated <a href="https://wave.webaim.org/">Wave WEBAIM</a> and <a href="https://littleforest.co.uk/">Little Forest</a> testing tool.</p>
    <p>This website was last manually tested by the Digital Library team, Library and University Collections, University of Edinburgh in February 2023. This was primarily using Mozilla Firefox (91.7.1esr), Microsoft Edge (99.0.1150.55) and Google Chrome (99.0.4844.84), browsers for comparative purposes. </p>
    <p>Recent world-wide usage levels survey for different screen readers and browsers shows that Chrome, Mozilla Firefox and Microsoft Edge are increasing in popularity and Google Chrome is now the favoured browser for screen readers:</p>
    <p><a href="https://webaim.org/projects/screenreadersurvey9/">WebAIM: Screen Reader User Survey</a></p>
    <p>The aforementioned three browsers have been used in certain questions for reasons of breadth and variety.</p>
    <p>We ran automated testing using <a href="https://wave.webaim.org/">Wave WEBAIM</a> and <a href="https://littleforest.co.uk/">Little Forest</a> then manual testing that included:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Spell check functionality;</li>
        <li>Scaling using different resolutions and reflow;</li>
        <li>Options to customise the interface (magnification, font, background colour, etc);</li>
        <li>Keyboard navigation and keyboard traps;</li>
        <li>Data validation;</li>
        <li>Warning of links opening in a new tab or window;</li>
        <li>Information conveyed in colour or sound only;</li>
        <li>Flashing, moving or scrolling text;</li>
        <li>Operability if JavaScript is disabled;</li>
        <li>Use with screen reading software (for example, JAWS);</li>
        <li>Assistive software (TextHelp Read and Write, Windows Magnifier, ZoomText, Dragon NaturallySpeaking, TalkBack and VoiceOver);</li>
        <li>Tooltips and text alternatives for any non-text content;</li>
        <li>Time limits;</li>
        <li>Compatibility with mobile accessibility functionality (Android and iOS).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Change Log</h2>
    <p>Since our first evaluation and statement, which was based on automated testing, we have undertaken extensive manual testing. This includes utilising a range of assistive technology to ensure we have a clear picture of the accessibility issues and how best to resolve them.</p>
