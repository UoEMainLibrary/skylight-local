    <h1>Mahabharata Scroll</h1>
        <div align="left">
        <p>The Edinburgh University’s 1795 copy of the Mahābhārata is now available online.  This beautiful scroll is one of the longest poems
          ever written, containing a staggering 200,000 verses spread along 72 meters of richly decorated silk backed paper. As one of the Iconic
          items in our Collection.

      <h2>Digitisation of the Mahabharata Scroll</h2>
      <div align="left">
        <p>Before the scroll could be digitised, Conservator Emily Hick had to stabilise the scroll edges which the wooden housing was causing
          to fray and snag. We had a plate made to insert under the scroll to provide a flat area for Emily to work on, which could also be used
          during photography.
        </p>
        <p>
          Following conservation the photography required a certain amount of problem solving when planning the studio set up. The scroll is
          elaborately decorated in gold and has dense, tiny text. The fine text was so small that it is difficult to read and had to be
          photographed at circa 2x magnification to enable readability. Despite the housing and roller arrangement, as the scroll was wound on
          there was a certain amount of lateral movement, around 1cm side to side. Furthermore, while the extensive gold is part of
          what makes this item so special, photographically it adds further layers of complexity. Gold illuminations can be hard to light-
          light from the side and it barely looks like gold, light from above and risk vast areas of specular burn out. Also, the ripple
          movement from the roller arrangment would cause the gold to reflect light at different angles, complicating the next stage of the
          project: stitching the images back together. Due to the fragility of the surface and critical light positioning we were not able to use
          glass to steady the surface, instead opting for ‘snakes’ –strings of weights used in the Special Collections Reading Room.</p>

<p>
          Calibration was done to ensure the lighting was even and neutral. A large overlap of images was made during photography to aid stitching.
          Undertaking a stitching job of this scale presented a significant project for the DIU: even assuming I could successfully stitch
          together the full scroll, it would make for an unimaginable file size and how would we deliver this in a useful format online? In recent
          years there has been some development in the automation of image stitching with improved algorithms of software such as Adobe and PTGui.
          However, the dense text, the variations in the gold rendering and the ripple movement of the scroll all conspired against successful
          automation. Stitching together manually took just under 3 months of work so the completion of the scroll was a moment of celebration
          in the DIU!</p>
