        <h1>SCOTLAND: A PERPLEXING PLACE …</h1>

        <p>Welcome to the digital archive of the <i>Scottish Government Yearbooks</i>, published by the University of Edinburgh's
            'Unit for the Study of Government in Scotland' between 1976 and 1992. The Unit was set up in the mid-1970s
            to address 'Our Changing Scotland' and the certainty – as it seemed at the time – of a devolved Assembly in
            Edinburgh. The <span class="italic">Yearbooks</span> reflect the spirit of that enterprise: contributions cut
            across academic disciplines … sociology, political science, social policy, history, economics, theology, education, medicine, law.
            And they spanned a wide range of academic institutions, centred upon – but not limited to – Scotland’s universities.
            But the Yearbooks went beyond academia to embrace lawyers, journalists, political activists, policy makers,
            civil servants, public sector managers, local government officers and clerics. Through this rich mix the
            <span class="italic">Yearbooks</span> sought, as the opening volume’s <a
                href="https://www.era.lib.ed.ac.uk/bitstream/1842/8996/1/1976_1_Our%20changing%20Scotland.pdf" target="_blank">editorial (Opens in a new tab)</a> made clear, to engage with a Scotland which was proving
            to be "a perplexing place".
        </p>
        <p>
            The <span class="italic">Yearbooks</span> provide unparalleled insights into a crucial period in Scotland's
            political and social development.
            They bear witness to, and carefully analyse, a Scotland in which a devolved Assembly seemed inevitable, a
            Scotland where those assumptions were dashed through the referendum of 1979, and a Scotland which rejected
            Thatcherism but endured its radical shaking of key institutions. The <span class="italic">Yearbooks</span>
            end in 1992, when 'home rule' stood reinvigorated and when the question of devolution was again dominating
            the Scottish political agenda. As the <a href="https://www.era.lib.ed.ac.uk/bitstream/1842/9344/1/1992_1_introduction.pdf" target="_blank">introduction (opens in a new tab)</a>
            to that final volume notes there was by then "a real sense of an uncompleted agenda" in,
            and for, Scotland. To address that agenda the <span class="italic">Yearbooks</span> morphed, in 1992, into
            <a href="http://www.euppublishing.com/journal/scot" target="_blank">Scottish Affairs (opens in a new tab)</a>, Scotland's
            longest running peer-reviewed journal of contemporary Scottish issues. And the Unit developed, briefly, into
            the Governance of Scotland Forum and from there into the Institute of Governance.

            In this archive you can find informed and critical articles on a wide range of topics of high relevance both
            to Scotland's past and to its future. In light of the 2014 referendum, the third on Scotland's constitutional
            relationship with/to the United Kingdom, the Institute of Governance
            felt the time was right to provide the full content of the <span class="italic">Yearbooks</span> online to all.
            Our changing Scotland remains a perplexing place with an uncompleted agenda: here you will find much that helps explain where,
            in our recent history, we have come from.
