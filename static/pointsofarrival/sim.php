                        ‘children’s transport’) Rescue of c.10,000 unaccompanied Jewish children from Germany and Nazi-occupied Europe to Britain 1938-1939. The last transport was 1940 
                        when the start of World War II made further rescue impossible.">Kindertransport.</abbr> Travelling alone and speaking 
                        little English, she was taken in by an Edinburgh family. After the war, Dorrith chose to remain in Edinburgh. She wrote a book about her experiences and became 
                        an ambassador and spokesperson for her fellow refugees.
