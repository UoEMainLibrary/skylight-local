                    A person is a Jew if they have Jewish parents. A Jew may choose to express their Jewishness by following the religion of Judaism. However, 
                    a person’s ‘Jewish status’ does not depend on them holding particular beliefs or following particular practices. A person may be identified 
                    as a Jew by others, and not feel that they would choose this identification themselves. Sometimes, non-Jews wish to identify people as Jewish 
                    for reasons that have nothing to do with a person’s self-understanding. Such motivation can be racist and

                    whether or not such an identification is meaningful to them.

                    and traditions can be traced to the communities that settled in Western Germany Northern France in the middle ages and then later to Eastern Europe 
                    (Poland-Lithuania commonwealth). Their spoken language was predominantly Yiddish. See also Yiddish"><em>Ashkenazi</em></abbr> Jews whose cultures and rituals

                    Jews who trace their origins to the Iberian peninsular, and <em>Mizrachi</em> Jews who hail from the Arab world, North Africa and the Middle East. 
                    Beyond that there are Jews identifying with smaller ethnic groupings such as Italian Jews, Chinese Jews, Afro-Carribbean Jews and so on.

                                Hebrew has been important as a scholarly language of the Jewish people for thousands of years. In the nineteenth century Hebrew was

                                Religious Jews need the company of other Jews to carry out key Jewish rituals. For a service at which the Torah is read, for example, most Jews need

                                Jews distinguish between a number of different categories of food which inform the way in which dishes are prepared and eaten. These dietary laws 
                                originate in the Hebrew Bible and are interpreted in different ways, including a complete rejection of their relevance. Basic distinctions are the

                                Among kosher foods the main distinctions are foods that contain meat (<em>fleishig</em>), foods that contain milk products (<em>milchig</em>) 
                                and foods that are neutral (<em>parev</em>). Meat and milk may not be consumed together in the same meal. Neutral foods can be eaten with either a meat 
                                or a milk meal. These distinctions form the basis of <abbr data-title="Kashrut (Hebrew) Complex set of
