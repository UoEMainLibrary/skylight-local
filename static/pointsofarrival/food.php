                Henry Wuga and his wife Ingrid worked for many years as <abbr data-title="Kosher (Hebrew): Label attached to food that is permitted 
                to eat under Jewish dietary laws. See also Kashrut">kosher</abbr> caterers. Kosher food is governed by the laws of 
                <abbr data-title="Kashrut (Hebrew) Complex set of Jewish dietary laws that are biblical in origin. Main characteristics are to regulate 
                the kinds of meat permitted (notably exclusion of shellfish and pork products), how meat and poultry are slaughtered, the prohibition of 
                the consumption of blood, and separation of meat from dairy foods. Food that follows these regulations is deemed kosher. See also kosher">
                kashrut</abbr>, which have their basis in the <abbr data-title="Torah: Hebrew Bible, consisting of the first five books of Moses. In synagogue, 
                a different portion of the Torah is read aloud each Sabbath, usually from a handwritten Torah scroll.">Torah</abbr> and 
                have been interpreted over the centuries by religious authorities so that they can be followed by Jews throughout the world. These laws determine which foods may 
                be eaten, how they should be prepared, and what they can be eaten with. For example, dishes containing milk and dishes containing meat may not be eaten together, 
                and the consumption of certain animals (such as pigs) and shellfish is forbidden. In order to keep a kosher kitchen, many Jews have two or three different sets of 
                utensils. Packaged food in supermarkets will often be marked with a special symbol, and certain shops display certificates, so that those who follow kashrut can be 
                sure that they are not buying <abbr data-title="Treyf: (also treif; Yiddish) Term for food that is forbidden under Jew dietary laws. See also kosher">treyf</abbr>

                Like all aspects of Jewish culture, Jewish food is often influenced by the part of the world in which it developed. <abbr data-title="Sephardi (Hebrew for Spain): 
                Jews of Spanish or Portuguese origin and traditions.">Sephardi</abbr> cuisine, with its roots in Spain, Southern Europe, and the Middle East, often includes the

                and Polish cuisine. Reflecting more recent migration patterns, Israeli food incorporates many dishes and ingredients from North African and Middle Eastern Arab 
                cuisines, such as <abbr data-title="Falafel: Fried chickpea croquettes, popular in Israel and Middle East.">falafel</abbr>, <abbr data-title="Couscous:  A popular North African eastern dish made from very small balls of durum wheat and served with a slow roasted chickpea stew.

                Many Jewish holidays are linked with particular foods, sometimes through scripture and sometimes through tradition. Plaited <abbr data-title="Challah: (pl. challot; Hebrew) Braided egg bread
