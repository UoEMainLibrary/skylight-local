                    Music is a central part of <a href="./religion">Jewish worship</a>. Many prayers are sung together by the whole congregation in <abbr data-title="Synagogue: Jewish place of worship.">synagogue</abbr>, and some Jewish families sing

                    <abbr data-title="Synagogue: Jewish place of worship.">Synagogue</abbr> singing is often lead by a prayer leader. This may be a rabbi, or it may be a <em>cantor</em> – normally a trained musician and singer who is also well-versed in Jewish 
                    liturgy (like <a href="./hirshow">Isaac Hirshow</a>). Many synagogues also have choirs, often trained by the cantor. In Reform and Liberal synagogues, the choir is mixed; 
                    in most Orthodox congregations it consists only of men.

                    (in some congregations three years), then entire Torah is chanted. This system of chanting is known as <em>cantillation</em>, and it uses small symbols written above the Hebrew 
                    letters in a Torah scroll. Jews around the world use different cantillation melodies, known as <em>nusakh</em>. The Eastern European <abbr data-title="Ashkenazi (pl. Ashkenazim; Hebrew). From Hebrew word for ‘Germany’. The term refers to Jews whose origins

                    and Yossele Rosenblatt (1882-1933) were as famous as opera stars in their day.

                    Synagogue music performs a very particular function, but it has also been a source of inspiration for many musicians outside the synagogue. The German composer Max Bruch, 
                    the French composer Maurice Ravel, and the Russian composer Dimitri Shostakovich have all used Jewish themes and motifs in their work, even though none of them was Jewish.
