        <h2>About the University Collections</h2>
        <p>
            Special Collections include manuscripts and archives, rare books, photographs, printed and handwritten music,
            architectural drawings, theses and microfilms. The collections relate to University of Edinburgh and its history,
            and to Scotland and the wider world.
        </p>
        <p>
            In total we have about 35 kilometres of historic material, much of which cannot be found anywhere else in the world.
        </p>
        <h2>University Collections Online</h2>
        <p>
            We aim to represent all of the University's rare and unique collections on this site, where possible there are links to websites where you can view the items within the collection.
