                    The University of Edinburgh enjoys a long-standing
                    and productive relationship with India and an
                    exhibition in the Library opening during the Fringe Festival
                    this year, the 70th anniversary of Indian Independence,
                    provides an excellent opportunity to showcase and
                    celebrate the University’s historic collections relating
                    to the sub-continent.

                    These objects – books, manuscripts, sculptures and
                    paintings – collected over a period of 300 years, span
                    two millennia of art and culture and are rich both in
                    variety and depth. Most of the objects have never been
                    exhibited in public before; this will be the first ever
                    public exhibition of University Collections devoted
                    to the art and culture of South Asia.
