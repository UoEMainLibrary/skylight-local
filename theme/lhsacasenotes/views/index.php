        <p>
            Lothian Health Services Archive (LHSA) is the archive of NHS Lothian, based in the Centre for Research
            Collections, University of Edinburgh. The Archive collects evidence of the history of healthcare in
            Edinburgh and the Lothians, from records of how Edinburgh’s NHS hospitals were founded and managed to
            privately donated collections gifted by individuals and organisations shaping the region’s medical history.
            LHSA records date from 1594 to the present day.

        <p>
            Patient records are an invaluable way of bringing Edinburgh’s historic breakthroughs in medical treatment and
            care to light. As well as bound accounts of treatment (dating back to the eighteenth century), LHSA holds over one million
            twentieth-century patient case notes in folders in one of the largest medical archives in the UK.
            The majority of these cases (although by no means all) were written in the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh.
            They cover both specific medical specialisms (from neurosurgery, respiratory disease and psychiatric care
            to orthopaedics and obstetrics) and more general medicine and surgery.
        </p>
        <p>
        In 2012, LHSA developed a methodology for cataloguing these modern archival case notes. Catalogues describe
            individual cases for researchers whilst protecting the privacy of patients through careful
            redaction of potentially identifying details. This resource acts as a gateway to these anonymised case note
            catalogues. It will guide you in using the catalogues for the first time, give context to key people,
            subjects and places, and will provide information for legitimate researchers on applying to access the
            confidential documents that they describe. At present, only finding aids for neurosurgical case notes can be
            accessed, but new catalogues will be added as they are completed.
