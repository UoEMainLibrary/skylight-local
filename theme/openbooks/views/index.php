    <p>This collection is compiled from readers’ orders for scans, principally in black and white and some in colour. They highlight the range of resources at The University of Edinburgh’s Centre for Research Collections, from Herschel’s music manuscripts, to ‘An Essay on the Character and Cerebral Development of Robert Burns,’ to Charles Lyell’s handwritten notes.
